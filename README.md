# LeetCode

Questions that I had problems solving or that are intereting and inspirational. 

Update 2018-06-03:
put the following code before Solution class to reduce run-time:

<code>static int x = []() { <br>
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); <br>
    cin.tie(NULL);  <br>
    return 0; <br>
}(); </code>
